# 概述
在ARM架构中，与时间相关的最主要的部件是计数器。整个架构的时间系统是这样构成的：
一个系统级的（所有部件共享的）计数器和计时器
                        --->  由系统计数器分发(Distribute)给各个子模块以及CPU的信号线
# 系统计时器
The System Timer peripheral provides four 32-bit timer channels and a single 64-bit free running
counter. Each channel has an output compare register, which is compared against the 32 least
significant bits of the free running counter values. When the two values match, the system timer
peripheral generates a signal to indicate a match for the appropriate channel. The match signal is then
fed into the interrupt controller. The interrupt service routine then reads the output compare register
and adds the appropriate offset for the next timer tick. The free running counter is driven by the timer
clock and stopped whenever the processor is stopped in debug mode。
